# Secret Santa

## Spec
You are managing the Secret Santa for CodeClan this year.  Each person will be responsible for buying one gift for a person at CodeClan, and you must ensure that everyone is both a giver and a recipient: once.

Ideally, you will make sure that giving within Cohorts is minimised, to make it less likely that people will guess who the gift is from.

## MVP

- Record the names of all the participants
- Allow for participants to be added, removed and edited until the final list has been generated
- Allocate each person one recipient, ensuring that no-one is giving to themselves
- Output a list of giver-recipient pairs which you can pass to the participants

## Possible Extensions

- Add details to each participant which can also be edited/deleted etc:
  - their Cohort
  - any gift preferences they have stated
- Ensure that there is a minimum of pairing within Cohorts
- Make it possible for someone to type in their own name and make changes to their preferences if the pairings have not been sent
- Once the pairings have been set, allow someone to type in their own name and be shown the name and preferences of their recipient (of course they could cheat and find out who their giver was but we'll assume they are playing nice)
- Anything else you think might be fun or useful
